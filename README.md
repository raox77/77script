# 77script
script was not made by me credits to gosheto imribiy AMITXV catgamerop i dont claim ownership

its all opensource i only made the script to make it easy for me since i do all of this whenever i install a new custom iso etc

and it makes it easy 

you use it at ur own risk

i tested them and everything works good for 

i didnt see any performance loss

make sure to make a backup of your registry before using the script 

how to?

open Regedit click once on "computer" then click on the top file "export" name it backup.reg you can place it on C drive then click on save

so if you had performance loss or whatever you didnt like after using the script use can use the backup.reg
